# C-Program
CS-210 Programming Languages

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Over this course, we have learned to use more than one programming language to utilize the strengths of different programs when used in conjuction. This project and program allowed students to learn how to do that with Python and C++ by taking a text file, passing that to Python and creating a new file that can be passed back to C++ for other uses. 

#What did you do particularly well?
I really focused on having no bugs present. I made sure to have data validation in multiple areas and continually swept the program for possible bugs. I feel that I have been strongest in that aspect of the programs I have created as a student this far. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think I could refactor a bit more in the main function of the C++ code. The menu that the user goes through can be written as a method to better shrink how large the content
of the main function is. It would make my code more efficient by having that menu portion appear as it's own. Although, I have always thought if the main portion of main
is going to be used the most by the user, it should be okay. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Data validations portions of the code were probably the most challenging. Some of those methods, I have not become an expert in and I think they may have been 
mentioned in our readings, but I don't think they are as huge of a focus right now. When needing extra help, I have been able to utilizie on-line resources. One of thje ones that has been super helpful is Stack Overflow. It looks like there are plenty of these types of networks online and I may be a subscriber or figure out a more concrete one as I continue to go through these courses. 

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Usually, we have only worked within one programming language before this course but I can see how it will be more than likely that we will begin to utilize multiple 
languages as I go into further higher courses. 

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The use of comments really helps in this respect if others need to be able to figure it out for updates. The main menu should be something that doens't need to be changed
to often but can be done with ease. The code is also broken down into the methods, so when needed, changes to those specific methods should be able to be managed without
changing major portions of the code.
